            <h3 class="White-Heading">What is the world wide web?</h3>
            <p class="White-Info" id="Info">The world wide web is a network which contains a range of information working in tandem with hypertext to give people easy and powerful access to a global information system.  Hypertext is a document that contains addresses/links to other parts of the document or a totally new document, this gives users easy access to information. The www ( world wide web ) is not the same as the Internet but rather a portion of it, thus we can say the www runs/operates within the Internet. When searching for information we use a URL or Uniform Resource Locator. The URL contains three elements that help it find information. One of the protocols used called HTTP is for web pages (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP" target="_blank"><span class="HTTP-Reference">click here to learn more</span></a> ) then we need the IP address or Domain Name of the server that holds the information and then to make searching for information even easier the Pathname for the file is optional. These three elements work in tandem to locate and request data for the user.</p>

                    Difference between the WWW and the Internet
                </h2>
                <p id="difference-www">
                    The Internet is simply a globally connected network which gives us access to resources for 
                    information. Whereas the World Wide Web gives us access to a huge array of documents which are 
                    connected to each other via hypertext or hypermedia links. If you think of the internet and the 
                    WWW in a very advanced level, you can say that the internet is the hardware and the WWW is the 
                    software. The WWW was only founded in 1989 whereas the internet was found in the late 1960’s. 
                    The internet uses IP addresses as identification, whereas the WWW uses Hypertext Transfer 
                    Protocol (HTTP).
